<h1>myMovies</h1>

<p>A sample application utilizing the React JS library, the omDB(Open movie database) API, localStorage, [more coming soon]</p>

- last searched text in title and year is used next time the app is opened if those text returned a movie (localStorage)
- search inputs requires minimum of 2 characters before calling API.
- input searching has a 1 second delay to lessen API calls while typing.
- dynamic site title (changes based on movie selected)
- year input (Only calls API if there is a title)
- shows a placeholder image for movie posters not available/missing
